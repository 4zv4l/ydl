# ydl

script to manage and download musics

## TODO

- [ ] download release from [here](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases/download/2023.07.06/yt-dlp) if not downloaded yet
- [ ] add `path` as argument to `ydl sync [get/give] [path]`, default would be set to `~/Music/Ydl`
- [ ] stick `module/file_transfer` to `ydl`
- [X] act as a client/server and send files via socket (no ssh needed)
- [X] use broadcast to find the server in the network
